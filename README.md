## "This project is all about IML and IRL commands of JPDB."

### About JsonPowerDB:
- JsonPowerDB is a Real-time, High Performance, Lightweight and Simple to Use, Rest API based Multi-mode DBMS. JsonPowerDB has ready to use API for Json document DB, RDBMS, Key-value DB, GeoSpatial DB and Time Series DB functionality.

- Schema-free, Simple to use, Nimble and In-Memory database.
- It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX
- It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
- It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost.
